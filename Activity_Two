What does the model achieve?
Figure out the linear relationship between temperature and pressure of air
How should metrics be interpreted?
The independent variable is the temperature in the unit of Kelvin, and the dependent variable is pressure in the unit of Pascal
What are appropriate use cases?
Temperature and pressure of a gas are typically two variables that fit with a linear relationship while applying the ideal gas law.
How is it implemented?
Applying linear regression to the data. And we should not misuse the data.
What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
The data is fake, and we should gain real data from experiments.
How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps?
Pressure of the air is directly proportional to the temperature. Therefore, when we store gas tanks, we should advisely store them in a cool place.
